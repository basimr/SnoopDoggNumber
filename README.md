# The Snoop Dogg Number

## Project Objective

Searching for the Erd≈ës of the music world through collaboration graphs.

## Recent Results

Using the "artist credit" proved to be the easiest way of finding collaboration edges between artists. However, the results are incorrectly skewed in favor of famous deceased deceased composers. See `find_edges_via_credit.sql` to see the query that generated the edges that led to these results.

Things are looking good for this project's titular artist.
